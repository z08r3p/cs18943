Assignment 3: Individual Report 
Assignment 3 is assessed on an INDIVIDUAL basis. Your solutions should   be   uploaded   to   Moodle as a single written document, which may   contain graphics   and   mathematics   (but   which does   not just list your code), and which makes   clear   links to well-labelled   MATLAB files which should   be   uploaded to   Moodle (as   .m files) at the same time.   Your   solutions   may be   in   PDF (e.g. generated via   LaTeX), Word, or   any other   appropriate format,   but   they   must      NOT depend on the   marker having access to any   additional   software   beyond   a   PDF   reader,   Microsoft Word, and a copy of MATLAB.   Credit will   be given   for   providing   working   code,   and   for providing suitable comments within the code to allow   it   to   be   used   accurately.
Simply submitting a collection of MATLAB files is not enough. 
There are 5 questions in this assignment, with   the   marks   for   each   question   indicated   at   the   end of the question.
Your report   needs to   be submitted to the VLE submission   point   by 4pm on Friday 10th January.
Late submission. 
Late submissions without   penalty are only allowed for participants who   have   been granted   an extension. To   request an extension   please see the   relevant form. on   the   moodle.
Otherwise, the   project   is subject to the standard   University   policy: “Work which is up to one hour late will have five percent of marks deducted. After one hour, ten percent of the available marks will be deducted for each day (or part of each day) that the work is late, up to a total of five days, including weekends andbank holidays e.g. if work is awarded a mark of 30 out of 50, and the work is up to one day late, the final mark is 25. After five days, the work is marked at zero.” For more details,   see Guide to Assessment, Standards, Marking and Feedback. 
Academic misconduct. 
Any collaboration with your fellow students should be avoided. The work   submitted for assessment   must   be yours and yours alone.   Remember that there are severe   penalties for   academic   misconduct offences such as plagiarism and collusion.   For   more   details,   see
Guide to Assessment, Standards, Marking and Feedback  .
Supply and Demand Model 
The assessment   is   based around a supply and demand   model   introduced   in the   paper
“   Landscape and flux theory of non-equilibrium open economy”   by Zhang    Wang   (link -   also   available at the VLE submission   point).    The model   is described   in   section   2.2   of the   paper and   models the   balance of price P   and quantity   Q   in a single   market.      It   should   be   noted   that   these values are the deviation from equilibrium values, so a   negative   price   refers   to   a   price below the equilibrium value. The relevant equations are   equation   6   in   t代 写Assignment 3: Individual ReportR

As   in the   paper, we are assuming that the speeds of adjustment   (labelled   α,      β       in the   paper)   are both equal to   1.    The remaining   parameters   ab,   c   and   d   are   related to   the   demand function and supply curve as defined   in the   paper.    You   can   refer to   the   paper   in   your   report,   but   if you wish to use any of the figures to aid   in your answers   to   the   questions   then   you should   produce your version of the figure.    For example,   it   may be   useful   to   include your   own   version of figure   1 from the paper. 
Question 1 
First, we consider the case where supply   is   linear (i.e. b      =      0).      Find      classify   all   fixed   points   using the   parameter values a    =   −      1,    b      =      0,      c      =      1      d      =   −      1.       Sketch a   phase   portrait, indicating any   interesting features.    Discuss your results   in the   context   of the   model.

Question 2 
Considering the full   model with (b    ≠       0),   produce   phase   plots of the system for   parameter   combinations
i)    a      = − 0.   5,      b      =      0.   3,      c      =      0,      d      = − 1.
ii)   a    = − 0.   1,      b      =      0.   3,      C      =      0,      d      = − 1.
iii)   a    =      0.   5,      b      =      0.   3,      C      =      0,      d      = − 1.
Annotate any relevant features and discuss your results   and   the   main   features   of the system’s   behaviour in the context of the model.      Repeat your analysis   of   parameter   set   i)   and   iii) with C    =   −    0.   3, again discussing   any   interesting   behaviour.

Question 3 
Using an appropriate   modification, add the effect of seasonality to the   model.      Use   the parameters from Question 2.   iii). Justify and discuss your choice   of seasonality,   including   your choice of parameter values and/or ranges, and explain   the   consequences   of these changes using example trajectories and/or   phase   plots. 
[20   marks]
Question 4 
Use an appropriate   modification   to   include   noise   into the system so that   it   can   be represented as a system of stochastic differential equations   (SDEs).      Provide a   careful   justification for your choice of noise term(s).   Use the parameters from Question 2.   i) 
Discuss the   results using example trajectories,   including interesting   behaviours   induced   by   the   noise.
[20   marks]
Question 5 
Summarise   how your findings could be used by   governmental   regulators,   or   by   businesses,   to guide their actions and ensure stable market   behaviours.   Your   answer   should   be   a maximum of 250 words   and should be accessible to   a   non-specialist   audience.
